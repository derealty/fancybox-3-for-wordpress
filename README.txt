== Description ==

Seamlessly integrates the fancyBox 3 script into your WordPress installation: Upload, activate, and you're done. Additional configuration is optional.

You can easily customize almost anything you can think about fancyBox lightbox. By default, the plugin will use jQuery to apply fancyBox to ANY thumbnails that link directly to an image. It will also automatically convert Wordpress image galleries into fancyBox galleries.

In upcoming versions, additional functionality for ajax calls, inline HTML, and iframe data will be implemented.
